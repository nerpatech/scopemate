The purpose of this script is to automate the process of removing unnecessary information from oscilloscope screenshots making them easier to read. It captures the screenshot, applies one or more transparency masks and outputs the result into an image file.

The script takes several inputs:

A resource identifier (instrument address) that specifies the connection details to the oscilloscope.

An optional list of masks, which are images used to overlay on top of the screenshot filling the area(s) with black pixels.

An optional output filename prefix, which allows the user to specify a custom name for the saved screenshot.

The script produces two main outputs:

A PNG image file containing the modified screenshot.

If the synchronize option is enabled, it also updates the oscilloscope's date and time settings to match those of the computer running the script.

Included transparency masks are made for Rigol MSO2000 series oscilloscope screen layout.  The script should be with DS2000 series instruments. The functionality is tested on Rigol MSO2032A.

Installation

* install and activate a virtual environment 
* install dependencies: pip install pyvisa pyvisa-py pillow
* connect your instrument to the same subnet
* run ./scopemate.py -l. If the instrument is reachable its' ID will be returned, which looks like that: TCPIP::<ip address>::INSTR
* run ./scopemate.py -i TCPIP::<ip address>::INSTR . A screenshot of the specified instrument will be taken and saved into an image file named 'screenshot-<date,time>.png

Usage

* Run ./scopemate.py -l. If the instrument is reachable its' ID will be returned
* Run ./scopemate.py -i TCPIP::<ip address>::INSTR . A screenshot of the specified instrument will be taken and saved into an image file named 'screenshot-<date,time>.png
* Run ./scopemate.py -i TCPIP::<ip address>::INSTR -m . A screenshot will be taken, default mask applied, and then saved A screenshot of the specified instrument will be taken and saved into an image file named 'screenshot-<date,time>.png

Below is the help output of the script:

usage: scopemate.py [-h] [-i INSTRUMENT] [-l] [-m [MASK ...]] [-o OUTPUT] [-s]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INSTRUMENT, --instrument INSTRUMENT
                        instrument to query
  -l, --list            list available instruments
  -m [MASK ...], --mask [MASK ...]
                        apply mask(s)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output filename prefix
  -s, --synchronize     sync instrument's date and time with a PC

Scopemate.py

Scopemate.py is a Python script designed to take a screenshot of an Oscilloscope, specifically the DS2000 series from Rigol. The purpose of this code is to automate the process of capturing images of the oscilloscope's screen, which can be useful for documentation, analysis, or even remote monitoring.

To use scopemate.py, you need to provide some input. You can either specify the name of the instrument (oscilloscope) you want to capture using the -i or --instrument flag, or simply list all available instruments on your system using the -l or --list flag. If you choose to capture an image, you'll also need to provide a mask file (an image with transparent areas) that will be overlaid onto the screenshot.

When you run scopemate.py with the required input, it produces a PNG image file of the oscilloscope's screen. The filename will include the current date and time, so each captured image is uniquely labeled.

The code achieves its purpose through a series of logical steps. First, it initializes the PyVisa library to communicate with the oscilloscope using the specified instrument name or resource. It then opens the oscilloscope's display data channel and reads the raw screenshot data from the instrument. This data is then converted into an image format that can be saved as a file.

One important logic flow in scopemate.py is the application of masks to the captured images. Masks are special images with transparent areas, which can help highlight specific features or measurements on the oscilloscope's screen. The code allows you to specify one or more mask files using the -m flag, and it will overlay these masks onto the screenshot before saving the final image.

Another important data transformation happening in scopemate.py is the synchronization of the oscilloscope's clock with a PC's system time. If you use the --synchronize flag, the code will query the oscilloscope for its current date and time and adjust it to match your PC's system time. This ensures that any timestamped measurements or data captured from the oscilloscope are accurately synchronized with your PC's clock.

Overall, scopemate.py is a useful tool for anyone who needs to capture images of an Oscilloscope screen, especially in situations where manual screenshots might be impractical or error-prone.
